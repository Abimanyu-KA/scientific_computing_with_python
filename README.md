## üèÜ Certification

- **Issued by:** freeCodeCamp
- **Date:** May 2025
- **Certificate Link:** [View Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Abimanyu-KA/scientific-computing-with-python-v7)

## üìö About

These projects demonstrate practical skills in Python, including problem solving, data manipulation, and object-oriented programming. Each project was completed as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

## üöÄ Project List

### 1. Arithmetic Formatter
Formats a list of arithmetic problems (addition and subtraction) vertically and side-by-side, optionally displaying the results.  
_File: `build-an-arithmetic-formatter-project`_

### 2. Time Calculator
Calculates the result of adding a duration to a starting time, supporting AM/PM format and optional day-of-week calculation.

### 3. Budget App
Implements a category-based budgeting app with methods to deposit, withdraw, transfer funds, and create a text-based spending chart.  
_File: `build-a-budget-app-project`_

### 4. Polygon Area Calculator
Defines classes for rectangles and squares, with methods for calculating area, perimeter, diagonal, and fitting shapes within each other.  
_File: `build-a-polygon-area-calculator-project`_

### 5. Probability Calculator
Simulates drawing colored balls from a hat to estimate probabilities using random sampling (Monte Carlo method).  
_File: `build-a-probability-calculator-project`_

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Each project is a standalone Python script or module.  
3. Open the corresponding file and follow the instructions in the code comments or docstrings.
